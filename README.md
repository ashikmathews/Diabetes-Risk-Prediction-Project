# Diabetes-Risk-Prediction-Project
This project uses health data to find out if a person may have diabetes. We clean the data, study it, train a model, and check how well it works. We also show which health facts matter most in the result.
📂 Dataset
Source: CDC BRFSS 2014 Diabetes Dataset

Features: Health-related questions like BMI, age, physical activity, blood pressure, etc.

Target: Whether the person has diabetes (Diabetes_012)
